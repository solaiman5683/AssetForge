# 💰 Support AssetForge Development

## The WinRAR Model - Our Philosophy

**AssetForge is 100% free. Forever.**

Just like WinRAR, we believe in the honor system. You can use AssetForge completely free without any limitations, ads, or nagging. However, if you find it useful and want to support continued development, you can choose to contribute.
